# Assignment 5

## 1 UDP check Algorithm

The code of algorithm is linked [here](https://github.com/new-rich/network-distribution-homework/blob/master/UDPCheck.py)



## 2 Excercise

### P1

a. Source port number is the port number of A,destination port number is 23

b. Source port number is the port number of B,destination port number is 23

c. Source port number is 23,destination port number is the port number of A

d. Source port number is 23,destination port number is the port number of B

e. Yes,the ip addresses of A and B are different.

f. No,S can't identify A and B for they have same ip.

### P4

a.01011100+01100101=11000001,the 1s complement of the sum is 00111110

b.11011010+01100101=100111111,after wrapping around,the result is 01000000,the 1s complement of the sum is 10111111

c.If the last bit in each of the 2 bytes is flipped,then the 2 bytes will be 01011101 and 01100100,the sum will not change.Thus,the 1s complement of the sum will not change.
