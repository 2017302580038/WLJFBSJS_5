## Homework 5

### python implementation of UDP checksum

```
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

packet = []

def check(data):
    sum = 0
    for i in range(0, len(data), 4):
        unitdata = int(data[i:i+4], 16)
        sum += unitdata
        sum = sum & 0xffffffff
    sum = (sum >> 16) + (sum & 0xffff)
    while sum > 0xffff:
        sum = (sum >> 16) + (sum & 0xffff)
    return 0xffff - sum
```

**P23.**

Suppose that the size of window is N. For protocol SR, if the indexes are messed up, there will be 2 conditions satisfied. First, the sender window should be [0, N], and the first 0 packet or its ACK packet is lost. Second, the receiver window should be [k-N+1, 0], and the 0 packet is a new version packet. We can find out that if the size of window is less than k-N+1, the two versions of the packets will never occur in the sender window and receiver window at the same time. In conclusion, N ≤ k/2 should be satisfied in SR.

GBN is similar to SR, and the conclusion for GBN is N ≤ k
