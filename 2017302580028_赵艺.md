### Charpter 3

#### Problem 3

The sum of there 8-bits bytes:
```
  01010011
+ 01100110
___________
  10111001
+ 01110100
___________
  00101101
+        1
___________
  00101110
```
Thus, its 1s complement is 11010001.

The 1s complement of the sum is endian independent. And it's easier to check the transmission and calculate the checksum when using 1s complement.

1-bit error can always be detected.

A 2-bit error may be undetected. For example, if the n-th bit of the first 8-bit byte is 0 and the n-th bit of the second 8-bit byte is 1 (0<n<=8), when these two bits reverse at the same time, the sum won't be affected.

#### Problem 4

a.
```
  01011100
+ 01100101
___________
  11000001
```
The 1s complement is 00111110

b.
```
  11011010
+ 01100101
___________
  00111111
+        1
___________
  01000000
```
The 1s complement is 10111111

c. 01011101 and 01100100
