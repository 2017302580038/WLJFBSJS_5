### P7

Initially, sequence numbers are used so that the receiver can tell whether a data packet is a duplicate of an already received data packet. But due to the stop-and-wait mechanism, we only need to determine whether a packet is a duplicate of the previously received data packet, that is, only 2 sequence numbers (0 and 1) are needed. We can model this scenario by introducing 2 states to the FSM. If the received data packet contains the sequence number corresponding to the receiver's state, then it transitions to a different state, otherwise it waits. Similar goes with the ACK packets at the sender.



### P15

*t<sub>trans</sub> = L* / *R* = 1500 * 8 / 10<sup>9</sup> = 12 microseconds/pkt

RRT = 30 milliseconds

*U<sub>sender</sub>* = *Nt<sub>trans</sub>* / (RRT + *t<sub>trans</sub>*) = 0.98

&rArr; 0.012*N* / 30.012 = 0.98

&rArr; *N* = 2451
