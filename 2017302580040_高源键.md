**UDP 16-bit checksum**

Implementation of UDP 16-bit checksum.  The calculation in 3.3.2 is also verified.

**P4**

a.

  01011100 + 01100101 = 11000001

  Its one's complement : 00111110
  
b.

   11011010 + 01100101 = 01000000
   
   Its one's complement : 10111111
 
 c.
 
   The first byte: 01010100
   
   The second byte: 01101101

**P5**

  No.
  
  Because calculating the checksum of a package cann't ensure that there are no transmission errors among its bits.
  
  Consider such situation: In a package, one word's last bit is 0, and another word's last bit is 1. 
  
  Even these two bits get flipped, their sum remains the same.And the 1's complement stays same.
  
  As a result, there IS transmission error while the checksum doesn't tell that.
