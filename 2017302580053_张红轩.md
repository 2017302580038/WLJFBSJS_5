The code is in : [Checksum Code](https://github.com/HongxuanZhang/Network_Pictures/blob/master/homework5/UDP.py)

The graphical results are like this (use the test example in 3.3.2,  pass the *Checksum* test if all columns of the last graph are 1):

(1) when nothing wrong in the UDP segment:

![nothing wrong situation](https://github.com/HongxuanZhang/Network_Pictures/blob/master/homework5/right_situation.png)

(2) I inject some errors into the receiver' UDP segment's data bit with a very low probability, and when some  errors occur, the graphical result is like follow:

(aï¼‰ The sum of 01011100 and 01100101 is 11000001, and the complement is 00111110

(b)   The sum of 11011010 and 01100101 is 100111111, the length of the result is longer than eight, so the first bit needs add to the last: 01000000, so the complement would be 10111111

(c)	For example, both bytes' third bits flipped, so the two bytes turn into  01111100 and 01000101, the answer would not change: 00111110.

## 2.P5

No, the receiver cannot be absolutely certain that no bit errors have occurred. This is because of the way packet checksums are calculated. If the corresponding bits of the two 16 bit words in the packet are 0 and 1 respectively,  if they are flipped to 1 and 0 respectively, the sum still remains the same. Therefore, the receiver will calculate the same inverse code, and would not know that two bits of the packet have been changed. For example, the P4(c), which means even some kinds of errors occurred, the receiver may still confirm.
