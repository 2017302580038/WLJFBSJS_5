# UDP Checksum
First, define a function to compute UDP checksum. `arr` is a list which contains all 16-bit words.
```
def checksum(arr):
    sum = reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, arr)
    return 0xffff - ((sum & 0xffff) + (sum >> 16))
```
Now do some tests. Data is provided by textbook in 3.3.2.
```
arr = [0b0110011001100000, 0b0101010101010101, 0b1000111100001100]
print("",bin(checksum(arr))[2:].zfill(16))
arr.append(checksum(arr))
print("",bin((0xffff-checksum(arr)))[2:].zfill(16))
```
Output:
```
1011010100111101
1111111111111111
```
I don't understand why `Matplotlib` is neccessary in this scenario, so I didn't use it. 

# 3 problems
## P2.
Destination port might be 26145 or 7532. Source port is 80. Destination IP might be A or C. Source IP is B.
## P5. 
No. If there are more than 1 error, the receiver might still get `1111111111111111`. Here's a counterexample:
```
1111111111111110->1111111111111111
0000000000000001->0000000000000000
0000000000000000
```
The checksums of the origial 3 16-bit words and those with 2 errors are both 0000000000000000, and the receiver will get 1111111111111111 still. 
## P6.
After the sender sending packet 0, it starts waiting for ACK 0. Then the reciver receives this packet without corruption, so it sends ACK 0. But if this ACK is lost, the sender will be always waiting for ACK 0 but the reciever be always waiting for packet 1, which is a deadlock.
