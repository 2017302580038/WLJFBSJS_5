### Question 1

> **P2.** Consider Figure 3.5 in textbook. What are the source and destination port values in the segments flowing from the server back to the clients’ processes? What are the IP addresses in the network-layer datagrams carrying the transport-layer segments?

>> **My Answer:**

Figure 3.5 in textbook says:

| Source IP | Source Port | Dest. IP | Dest. Port |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| A | 26145 | B | 80 |
| C | 7532 | B | 80 |
| C | 26145 | B | 80 |

So, the answer to this question is:

| Source IP | Source Port | Dest. IP | Dest. Port |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| B | 80 | A | 26145 |
| B | 80 | C | 7532 |
| B | 80 | C | 26145 |

### Question 2

> **P4.**

> **a.** Suppose you have the following 2 bytes: 01011100 and 01100101. What is the 1s complement of the sum of these 2 bytes?

>> **My Answer:**
>>
>> 01011100 + 01100101 = 11000001
>> 1s complement of 11000001 is 00111110

> **b.** Suppose you have the following 2 bytes: 11011010 and 01100101. What is the 1s complement of the sum of these 2 bytes?

>> **My Answer:**
>>
>> 11011010 + 01100101 = (1)00111111 = 00111111 + 00000001 = 01000000
>> 1s complement of 01000000 is 10111111

> **c.** For the bytes in part (a), give an example where one bit is flipped in each of the 2 bytes and yet the 1s complement doesn’t change.

>> **My Answer:**
>>
>> 1st byte: 01011100 -> 01011101
>> 2nd byte: 01100101 -> 01100100
>> 
>> 01011101 + 01100100 = 11000001
>> 1s complement of 11000001 is 00111110, which doesn’t change.
