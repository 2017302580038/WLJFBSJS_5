#### 2.P2 and  P12

P2.

From B to C:

Connection on the left: source port 80, source IP is the IP of B, destination port 26145, destination IP is the IP of C;

Connection on the right: source port 80, source IP is the IP of B, destination port 7532, destination IP is the IP of C;

From B to A:

Source port number 80, the source IP is the IP of B; destination port 26145, the destination IP is the IP of C;

P12. 

When there is only one bit error, the protocol works normally, but it may respond faster than the rdt 3.0 sender. When the timer time is too short, each packet that is retransmitted in time-out will cause the packet that is being sent to be retransmitted. Thus, the number of packets sent will tend to be infinite from the first packet to the n packet.
