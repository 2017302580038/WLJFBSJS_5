## 第三章后作业选做2题

T7:

To best answer this question, consider why we needed sequence numbers in the first place. We saw that the sender needs sequence numbers so that the receiver can tell if a data packet is a duplicate of an already received data packet. In the case of ACKs, the sender does not need this info (i.e., a sequence number on an ACK) to tell detect a duplicate ACK. A duplicate ACK is obvious to the rdt3.0 receiver, since when it has received the original ACK it transitioned to the next state. The duplicate ACK is not the ACK that the sender needs and hence is ignored by the rdt3.0 sender.

T8:

The sender side of protocol rdt3.0 differs from the sender side of protocol 2.2 in that timeouts have been added. We have seen that the introduction of timeouts adds the possibility of duplicate packets into the sender-to-receiver data stream. However, the receiver in protocol rdt.2.2 can already handle duplicate packets. (Receiver-side duplicates in rdt 2.2 would arise if the receiver sent an ACK that was lost, and the sender then retransmitted the old data). Hence the receiver in protocol rdt2.2 will also work as the receiver in protocol rdt 3.0.
